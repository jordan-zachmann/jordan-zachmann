### Hey, I'm Jordan!

* I currently work for Productivity Quality Inc, where I build/maintain Windows applications, assist with Excel macros and operations, and work on improving routine tasks at various shop floors and labs.
* I have worked on various research projects at my alma mater university (St. John's University) studying stars, as well as a project studying lakes and fires with NASA's Student Airborne Research Program.

Not all of my daily work uses Github, so periods of inactivity here reflect that.
